## üåü Summary

Transparent Classroom Photos Grabber is a robust command-line tool that allows you to easily download and organize photos from your child's Transparent Classroom account. The application automatically handles authentication, crawls through all available posts, and downloads photos with proper metadata including GPS coordinates and timestamps.

Built in Rust for performance and reliability, this tool ensures you never miss precious classroom moments while maintaining a well-organized photo collection. It provides seamless handling of authentication, caching to avoid unnecessary downloads, and smart fallback mechanisms to ensure the best possible experience.

## üöÄ How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo installed ([install instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
- Transparent Classroom account credentials
- School ID and Child ID from Transparent Classroom

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/harperreed/transparent-classroom-photos-grabber-rs.git
cd transparent-classroom-photos-grabber-rs

# Build the project
cargo build --release
```

### Configuration

You can configure the application in several ways:

#### Option 1: Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export TC_EMAIL="your.email@example.com"
export TC_PASSWORD="your_password"
export SCHOOL=12345        # Your school ID
export CHILD=67890         # Your child ID
export SCHOOL_LAT=41.9032  # School latitude
export SCHOOL_LNG=-87.6663 # School longitude
export SCHOOL_KEYWORDS="school, montessori, chicago"  # Keywords for metadata
```

#### Option 2: Create a .env File

Create a `.env` file in the project directory with these values (see `.env.example`).

#### Option 3: Interactive Setup

Run the setup command to configure the application interactively:

```bash
cargo run --release -- setup
```

### Running

```bash
# Basic usage (downloads to default ./photos directory)
cargo run --release

# Specify a custom output directory
cargo run --release -- --output /path/to/output/directory

# Run in dry-run mode (shows what would be downloaded without downloading)
cargo run --release -- --dry-run

# Show verbose output for debugging
cargo run --release -- --verbose
```

### Command-line Options

```
Usage: tc-photos-grabber [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

Commands:
  setup     Set up configuration interactively
  download  Download photos (default command)
  config    Show current configuration
  help      Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -o, --output <DIR>  Output directory for downloaded photos
      --dry-run       Run in dry-run mode (show what would be downloaded without downloading)
  -v, --verbose       Verbose output
  -h, --help          Print help
  -V, --version       Print version
```
